# Personnal memos for GitHub and Git
Only contains few commands that I will use daily! Personnal repo that is made public for exercising purposes.

git clone [URL] -> clone a repo from GitHub to PC

git commit -a -m [message in ""] -> commit ALL changes with message

git push origin master -> push changes to GitHub master branch

git pull origin master -> pull changes from GitHub master branch to local

git init -> make directory into git directory

git add <file> -> add specified file to stage

git add . -> add all files to stage

git commit -m "messge" -> commit staged files

git remote add origin [URL] -> after creating empty repo, remotely connects repo to ur local files (understood but hard to explain)
